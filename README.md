Hi! I"m not sure if anyone would ever find this, but still,
My name is Shashwat Sharma, I'm a Indian student doing major in computer science.
I also wish to pursue an accounting course that goes by the name Chartered Accountancy that is really difficult, but I wish to do so to get into fin-tech industry.
People call me stupid and scatter brained cuz of stepping into 2 boats far away from each other, but Im passionate about it.
As of right now I'm learning python, R and blender.
I wonder if my dreams would ever come true...
I feel really lonely all the time so i take the help of anime, manga and video games. i also like a streamer named Tricky who makes me happy, thats the namesake for this account.
Best of luck to everyone reading this!!!
